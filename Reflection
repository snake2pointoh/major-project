Hardest?
  Ai pathfinding and pathfinding optimisation
  - i was able to create pathfinding with A* and optimise it by running one at a time every other frame.

If i Were to do it Again?
  instead of using Javascript use something like c++ or c# in programs like unreal engine or unity.

Did i complete all my need to haves?
  i was able to complete all of my need to haves so that they are all working but i would have liked to polish them a bit more.
